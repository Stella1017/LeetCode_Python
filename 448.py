# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array (Easy)

# Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

# Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

# Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

# Brute Force
